# MatLearn
MatLearn code packaged for a general user (requires Jupyter Notebook).

The Jupyter Notebook (MatLearn_User.ipynb) is designed to walk a user who is inexperienced with machine learning through the basics of retrieving data, cleaning data, training a model, and generating predictions from scratch. This worksheet is supported by the code included in MatLearn_User_functions.py.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x (recommend installing Miniconda https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/install)
- Pymatgen (https://pymatgen.org/installation.html)
- Pandas
- Sci-Kit Learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
